Book-a-room room is a BOT that lets you easily book meeting rooms via a bot. The users can look at available rooms depending on the selected location and time and select one from the list to book the room. 

The BOT will also let you mark a room as favorite, so that you can quick book the same room if available for future bookings.	

It will work in a personal scope only and doesn’t have a Teams scope or a messaging extension.

It will not have any supporting Config Web App as it doesn’t require any custom configuration settings.
