Book-a-room bot will let you easily book a room on the go with minimum clicks as possible in a personal scope. The users can look at available rooms depending on the selected location/building and time and select one from the list to book the room.

As a first run experience, it will suggest you to mark your frequently booked rooms as favorites in the app to enable you to quick book the same room if available for future bookings.

It is currently designed to work in personal scope.
